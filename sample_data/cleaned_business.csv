"How A Business Works was an excellent book to read as I began my first semester as a college student. Although my goal is to major in Business, I started my semester off with no idea of even the basic guidelines a Business undergrad should know. This book describes in detail every aspect dealing with business relations, and I enjoyed reading it. It felt great going to my additional business classes prepared and knowledgeable on the subject they were describing. Very well written, Professor Haeberle! I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like additional knowledge pertaining to business matters."
This is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts. Fried summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with brilliant business principles to help you become the entrepreneur of your own existence. I LOVED it.
"Easy read.  A tale of burning and flying, acceptance and soaring. I applaud this book describing a successful businessman who decides to chuck it all in hopes of finding out the big WHY.  An almost believable story that combines humanness with spirituality, ya know, super oneness and love. I appreciated the author's command of the written word. It is alerting us to become aware we are on a journey of light and love. It's about meditation and where it can lead us. A story built around seeking,  Thank you Jacob for sharing this teaching with us."
Whether just starting out with a new business or being a seasoned owner pregnancy will throw some curve balls.  This book helps you navigate through business and pregnancy and how they relate to one another. Must read for women who own their own businesses and want/are starting a family.**Disclosure - I received a copy of this book for review purposes. However all opinions are my own.

"I read a lot of motivational, business and self help books. This one is nothing like the others. There's a ton of great advice in this book, much of  it is counter to conventional wisdom. I found it refreshing to read because the author is not afraid to say things that may be unpopular. My only real complaint is that it is such an easy book to read (feels like you are in the room listening to him speak)that you may end up flying through some of the great points without them registering fully. Read this one with a highlighter in hand."
